# Using Git

A guide to using setting up a local git installation connected to GitHub.

## Installation

Linux users can install the `git` package, e.g. `apt-get install git`.

For other platforms, download from [git-scm.com/download](http://git-scm.com/download/).

## Graphical tools

Windows and Mac users can use a GUI tool to manage their git repository locally, with GitHub integration built in:

- [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
- [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/)

## Command line

Linux users should follow the [Command Line Git Guide](git.md). Windows and Mac users can also follow this guide, but note that setup is different and there will be slight variations in usage.
